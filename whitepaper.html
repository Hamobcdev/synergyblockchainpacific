    <h2>Whitepaper: Synergy Blockchain Pacific</h2>
    <div class="document-list">

      <div class="document">
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p><strong>Synergy Blockchain Pacific</strong> is Samoa’s first native blockchain development studio and DAO infrastructure provider. We exist to accelerate Samoa’s sovereign integration into the global Web3 economy — by building decentralized tools, token-powered services, and regulatory-ready platforms that serve both grassroots and enterprise users.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="document">
        <h3>2. Vision</h3>
        <p>To position Samoa as a Pacific leader in digital infrastructure innovation, with a blockchain-native economic layer that connects local enterprises, regulators, farmers, artisans, diaspora and regional ecosystems — while supporting long-term sovereignty and sustainability through on-chain governance and value exchange.</p>

        <h3>5. Technology Stack</h3>
        <p>Built on Ethereum-compatible Layer-2 infrastructure, we integrate Chainlink for oracle data, IPFS for storage, DID for identity, and AI agents for automation of governance, market-making and registry updates.

      <div class="document">
        <h3>6. Token Economics</h3>
        <p>The <strong>PSF Token</strong> powers governance, access control, grant distribution, rewards, and reputation. Tokenomics are designed to support long-term sustainability with emission-based unlocks tied to roadmap milestones and smart contract automation for DAO operations.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="document">
        <h3>7. Governance Framework</h3>
        <p>Synergy Blockchain Pacific will operate as a sovereign Samoa-based DAO connected to the Pasifika regional DAO. Our governance model blends token voting, GitHub contribution scoring (Pasifika Proof-of-Work), and cultural delegation for knowledge-sensitive areas.</p>
